Summary:
                    The collection of high quality data gives companies a significant competitive advantage in their decision making process. It helps in understanding customer behavior and enables the use and deployment of new technologies based on machine learning. However, the processes and applications used by data scientists to collect and clean data and are often manual, non-optimized and error-prone. This increases the time it takes for data to deliver value to the business. To reduce this time companies are looking into automation and validation of data processes. Data processes are the operational side of data analytics workflows. DataOps, a term recently coined by data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers, refers to a common process intended to shorten end-to-end data analytic life-cycle time by introducing automation into the data collection, validation, and validation process Does. Despite its growing popularity among practitioners, research on this topic is limited and it does not provide a clear definition for the term or how the data analysis process evolved from fully automated data analytics to ad hoc data collection as envisioned by DataOps. it occurs. This research provides three main contributions. First, using the multi-faceted literature we provide a definition and a scope for the common process referred to as DatOps. Second, based on a case study with a large mobile telecommunications organization, we analyze how many data analytics teams develop their infrastructure and processes for the data base. In addition, we provide a ladder showing the various stages of the development process. With this growth model, companies can identify the stage they belong to and, at the same time, overcome the challenges faced in the current phase and try to move to the next stage.

Conclusion:
                       The collection of high quality data gives companies a significant competitive advantage in their decision making process. It helps in understanding customer behavior and enables the use and deployment of new technologies based on machine learning.
