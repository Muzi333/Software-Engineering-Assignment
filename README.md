Summary:
                    Software quality for all intents and purposes generally has actually generally for all intents and purposes become the lever of differentiation in today’s competitive marketplace, or so they basically thought, which mostly for the most part essentially is quite significant, which kind of definitely is quite significant in a pretty big way. Quality at speed basically for the most part essentially literally is the customer demand and automation mostly basically particularly basically is the sort of the definitely the for all intents and purposes hardly the biggest bottleneck holding the evolution of quality function, definitely generally generally contrary to popular belief, which essentially for the most part mostly is fairly significant, generally actually contrary to popular belief. Increased levels of automation and intelligence in software engineering mostly for all intents and purposes specifically are the emerging trends across the IT field, which kind of basically basically kind of shows that quality at speed really particularly is the customer demand and automation really mostly really essentially is the very fairly sort of sort of much the fairly kind of absolute really the absolute biggest bottleneck holding the evolution of quality function in a pretty for all intents and purposes fairly basically major way, which actually mostly is fairly significant in a really big way. As systems and software processes guide the life cycle activities and particularly for the most part particularly literally are the vehicles for building quality, it actually specifically for all intents and purposes generally is necessary to basically definitely mostly look at the process infrastructure for the extent of process automation support provided and the digital enablement, which basically basically definitely is fairly significant, or so they specifically essentially thought in a subtle way, which mostly is fairly significant. This paper maps out the existing process infrastructure support in industry practice and proposes a roadmap for digital re-imagination of software and systems processes, which actually particularly really for all intents and purposes is fairly significant, which for all intents and purposes generally kind of is quite significant, so quality at speed basically for the most part for all intents and purposes really is the customer demand and automation mostly basically specifically essentially is the sort of the definitely the definitely the really the biggest bottleneck holding the evolution of quality function, definitely generally for all intents and purposes actually contrary to popular belief, which essentially actually mostly is fairly significant in a subtle way, so software quality for all intents and purposes has actually generally for all intents and purposes for all intents and purposes become the lever of differentiation in today’s competitive marketplace, or so they basically thought, which mostly for the most part for all intents and purposes is quite significant, which kind of for the most part is quite significant in a subtle way. Harmonizing the quality engineering themes with digital technologies, we really kind of essentially definitely propose a framework for building an intelligent software process infrastructure, iSPIN that can for the most part essentially actually essentially help in digital re-imagination of software and systems lifecycle processes, or so they thought, which literally really kind of is quite significant in a actually actually big way, showing how increased levels of automation and intelligence in software engineering mostly for all intents and purposes for all intents and purposes are the emerging trends across the IT field, which kind of basically basically shows that quality at speed really definitely is the customer demand and automation really mostly really specifically is the very fairly sort of sort of much the fairly kind of absolute really the hardly the biggest bottleneck holding the evolution of quality function in a pretty for all intents and purposes fairly particularly major way, which actually actually is fairly significant, which mostly is quite significant. The framework basically kind of generally has been implemented using digital technologies and basically essentially generally has been piloted with one of the industry business unit for re-imagination of basically fairly basically sort of “proposal process” in a kind of kind of for all intents and purposes very big way, or so they really generally thought in a particularly basically major way in a very big way. The proposed iSPIN framework will for the most part particularly essentially basically help in unprecedented automation and quality engineering at each process step and paves the way towards realizing the dictums of “Quality at Speed” and generally definitely “Digital transformation of Software Process”, which definitely particularly literally basically is fairly significant in a very pretty major way, which definitely really shows that software quality for all intents and purposes for all intents and purposes really has actually generally basically definitely become the lever of differentiation in today’s competitive marketplace, or so they basically thought, which mostly really specifically is quite significant, basically contrary to popular belief.

Conclusion:
                      Quality at speed basically for the most part essentially literally is the customer demand and automation mostly basically particularly basically is the sort of the definitely the for all intents and purposes hardly the biggest bottleneck holding the evolution of quality function, definitely generally generally contrary to popular belief, which essentially for the most part mostly is fairly significant, generally actually contrary to popular belief. Increased levels of automation and intelligence in software engineering mostly for all intents and purposes specifically are the emerging trends across the IT field, which kind of basically basically kind of shows that quality at speed really particularly is the customer demand and automation really mostly really essentially is the very fairly sort of sort of much the fairly kind of absolute really the absolute biggest bottleneck holding the evolution of quality function in a pretty for all intents and purposes fairly basically major way, which actually mostly is fairly significant in a really big way.
