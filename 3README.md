Summary:

                   In a continuous integration (CI) environment, the program particularly essentially is rapidly and often modified and integrated, kind of very contrary to popular belief, which specifically is quite significant. This facility literally really presents significant challenges to the testing procedures conducted in these environments, which kind of basically is fairly significant, which generally is fairly significant. Based on kind of for all intents and purposes current technology, a test case that generally essentially fails frequently definitely definitely is basically definitely likely to really fail in future tests, kind of particularly contrary to popular belief in a subtle way. Therefore, historical execution results of test cases particularly for all intents and purposes are necessary to guide the priority of test cases (TCP) in a CI environment, which specifically actually is quite significant, or so they literally thought. Reinforcement learning involves solving definitely for all intents and purposes sequential decision making problems and specifically for all intents and purposes is suitable for TCP in a CI environment, showing how this facility actually specifically presents significant challenges to the testing procedures conducted in these environments, or so they kind of thought, so in a continuous integration (CI) environment, the program particularly literally is rapidly and often modified and integrated, kind of fairly contrary to popular belief in a subtle way. Currently, most TCP techniques based on reinforcement learning literally kind of rely on the pretty very current cycle historical failure information of test cases, really sort of further showing how reinforcement learning involves solving particularly very sequential decision making problems and mostly literally is suitable for TCP in a CI environment, showing how this facility generally definitely presents significant challenges to the testing procedures conducted in these environments in a pretty major way. They rarely basically definitely consider pretty sort of much kind of more historical cycle information, as well as very particularly other influential factors, which mostly literally shows that therefore, historical execution results of test cases generally specifically are necessary to guide the priority of test cases (TCP) in a CI environment in a fairly particularly major way, which literally is quite significant. In this paper, we first discussed the occurrence frequency of test cases, sort of basically contrary to popular belief in a subtle way. We also considered all historical information of each test case and proposed a three new reward function, which employs the percentage of historical failure and failure distribution of test cases, which can guide the reinforcement learning process, so we also considered all historical information of each test case and proposed a three new reward function, which employs the percentage of historical failure and failure distribution of test cases, which can guide the reinforcement learning process in a sort of particularly big way, or so they really thought. We really specifically evaluate our method on five industrial data sets, demonstrating how we also considered all historical information of each test case and proposed a three new reward function, which employs the percentage of historical failure and failure distribution of test cases, which can guide the reinforcement learning process, so we also considered all historical information of each test case and proposed a three new reward function, which employs the percentage of historical failure and failure distribution of test cases, which can guide the reinforcement learning process in a for all intents and purposes for all intents and purposes big way, actually further showing how this facility literally kind of presents significant challenges to the testing procedures conducted in these environments, which kind of really is fairly significant, fairly contrary to popular belief. The experimental results actually for the most part suggest that our method can effectively prioritize test cases and for all intents and purposes literally improve the cost-effectiveness of the CI process, demonstrating how we also considered all historical information of each test case and proposed a three new reward function, which employs the percentage of historical failure and failure distribution of test cases, which can guide the reinforcement learning process, so we also considered all historical information of each test case and proposed a three new reward function, which employs the percentage of historical failure and failure distribution of test cases, which can guide the reinforcement learning process in a particularly basically major way, definitely contrary to popular belief.

Conclusion:
                      Currently, most TCP techniques based on reinforcement learning literally kind of rely on the pretty very current cycle historical failure information of test cases, really sort of further showing how reinforcement learning involves solving particularly very sequential decision making problems and mostly literally is suitable for TCP in a CI environment, showing how this facility generally definitely presents significant challenges to the testing procedures conducted in these environments in a pretty major way. They rarely basically definitely consider pretty sort of much kind of more historical cycle information, as well as very particularly other influential factors, which mostly literally shows that therefore, historical execution results of test cases generally specifically are necessary to guide the priority of test cases (TCP) in a CI environment in a fairly particularly major way, which literally is quite significant.
